# Method
You are given java code. Run it and see what it does ðŸ˜Š Then modify it so that it has all the necessary methods in order to make the overall code modular. Save your modified (modular) java file as:

methods_matric.java and submit it via the Putrablast link provided.

For pointersâ€¦ these methods might be necessary:

1. getDiscount( )

2. displayDiscount( )

3. getShippingPrice( )

4. getQuantity( )

5. calcProductPrice( )

6. calcTotal( )

7. dispFinalPrice( )

Think what you wish about what each function does. If you donâ€™t agree with the names, or have ideas of your ownâ€¦ write whatever code you believe is necessary ðŸ˜Š As I always say, thereâ€™s always more than one thing to do thing!!! ðŸ˜Š You can have more or less methods, if you'd like ðŸ˜Š
